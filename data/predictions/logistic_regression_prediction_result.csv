However, she has been a customer for only 3 months, which could also suggest a lower tendency to churn. The model predicts a 66% probability of churn."

However, their tenure is relatively short (2 months) and the monthly charges are lower than average (105.3), which could indicate a lack of loyalty or engagement with the service. Conversely, the total charges of 130 are low, which might suggest they are satisfied with their overall experience. Further analysis is required to determine the exact reason for churn."
